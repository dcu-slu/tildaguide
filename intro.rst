What is Tilda?
==============

Overview
--------

Tilda is a publishing and archival tool designed to store and disseminate
research- and environmental monitoring data produced at SLU. Through the website
interface it is possible for researchers to upload data, and describe datasets
with associated metadata. Tilda also features a search function where anyone may
search and access openly available data produced at the university.

Metadata in Tilda is harvested by other data portals such as OpenAIRE and
www.oppnadata.se on a regular basis; data registered in Tilda is thereby
discoverable on several locations. Datasets in Tilda are also supplied a
persistent and unique identifier ensuring long term discovery and citablity.


The need for publishing and archiving of research data
------------------------------------------------------

Research materials, such as research data, produced at public universities are
considered public records and are therefore subject to mandatory archiving.
Tilda is designed to support and enable this process by providing archival
storage in accordance with international standards for long-term preservation of
digital records.

There are several benefits of publishing and archiving research data for the
individual researcher as well as for the larger research community:

* Making data reusable and reviewable.
* Citable datasets
